			<p>PointProjector is a free little plugin for <a href="https://www.maxon.net">Maxon Cinema 4D</a> projects the ponts of any polygon or spline object on a geometry. Since PointProjector is a deformer object, it works non-destructively.</p>

			<p>PointProjector was written because I wanted to be able to do dynamic on-the-fly projection of points, and because Cinema 4D's builtin Project function only works with splines. It is a good example for a simple deformer object plugin.</p>

			<h2>Installation</h2>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>If you have already an older version of PointProjector installed (maybe even still called &quot;SplineProjector&quot;), remove its directory.</li>
					<li>Just unzip the archive and place the folder &quot;PointProjector&quot; inside the folder &quot;Cinema 4D Rxx/plugins&quot;.</li>
					<li>When you start Cinema 4D the next time, PointProjector will be available from the <i>Plugins</i> menu.</li>
				</ol>
      </p>

			<h2>Help</h2>
			<p>Attributes explained...</p>

			<h3>Projector</h3>
			<p>All attributes used for the point projection are found here.</p>

			<div class="indent">
				<h4>Link</h4>
				<p>Link the geometry you want to project the points on here.</p>
				<p>Polygon objects and any generator that generates polygon objects should work.</p>
			
				<h4>Mode</h4>
				<p>Select the projection mode here:
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p><strong>Parallel</strong></p>
							<p>Points are projected along the direction of the PointProjector's Z axis.</p>
							<p>Good for projecting roads on landscapes, blankets on the ground, et cetera.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>Spherical</strong></p>
							<p>Points are projected away from the PointProjector's position.</p>
							<p>Good for projecting stuff inside cavities or concave objects.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h4>Offset</h4>
				<p>Move the projected points along the face normal of the geometry they've been projected on.</p>
			
				<h4>Blend</h4>
				<p>Seamlessly blend between projected and unprojected shape.</p>
			
				<h4>Geometry Falloff</h4>
				<p>Enables the geometry falloff mode.</p>
				<p>In geometry falloff mode, points are projected only within a certain range, starting from the PointProjector object. Within that range, points are moved towards the surface using a soft step interpolation.</p>
			
				<h4>Distance</h4>
				<p>Defines the size of the falloff area around the PointProjector.</p>
			</div>

			<h3>Falloff</h3>
			<p>This tab provides the standard Falloff functionality, as known from other deformers and effectors in Cinema 4D.</p>
